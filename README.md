## How to use this tutorial

This tutorial assumes you have some beginner programming knowledge, and a basic understanding of arrays.

Primitive data will be given in this format:

---

### `<usage>` <primitive name>

**Symbol:** `<symbol>`

**Args:** `<types of args>`

**Description:** Create a dict with keys `x` and values `y`. `x` and `y` must be of equal length.

Each part of this tutorial will have `Vocabulary` and `Exercise` (pending) sections at the end. I suggest getting familiar with the vocabulary and doing the exercises in each part before moving on the next lesson.
