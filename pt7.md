# Debugging and Errors

One thing that array languages used to be (and still are) notorious for are their terrible error messages.
APL and J try to work around this problem with their debugging tools, but the problem still remains that errors are not very descriptive.

K does not have complex debugging tools available, and it has the worst errors that I know from an array language.
This page will attempt to disambiguate all the possible errors that ngn/k can throw, and the methods you can use to find what is going wrong with your K program.
