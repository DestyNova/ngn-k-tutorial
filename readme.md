## How to use this tutorial

This tutorial assumes you have some beginner programming knowledge, and a basic understanding of what arrays are.

The progression will start from explaining basic primitives, and move on to bigger concepts. The final few chapters will implement full programs in K,
step by step.

Each part of this tutorial covering the basics will have `Vocabulary` and `Exercise` (pending) sections at the end. I suggest getting familiar with the vocabulary
and doing the exercises in each part before moving on the next lesson.

If you are feeling stuck with the tutorial's content or exercises, please come to the [ngn/k room on matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ngnk:matrix.org)
(recommended), the [APL farm](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/APL_Farm), or just open an issue here.

If you would like to check your exercise solutions with mine, you can check the `code` folder.

# Progress
This tutorial is complete, and will not see the addition of any further
chapters, unless ngn/k undergoes new changes.

Any other chapter ideas that were previously here may be covered in separate
articles, outside this book. No promises though :)

# Credits
 - [ngn](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k) many tidbits and useful knowledge on the workings of ngn/k
 - @chrispsn, @Traws, @ColTim for ideas on the Prelude chapter, and primitive implementations
 - @HoosierEE for help with proofreading and many useful edits
 - @DiscoDoug for a lot of help with writing the sudoku chapter
 - [/u/mandus](https://old.reddit.com/u/mandus) for reminding me that I had exercises on this tutorial
 - @DestyNova for setting up the workflows required for the website, epub and pdf.

Finally, thanks to all the proofreaders who helped me ensure the quality of
this book over the two years spent writing it.
