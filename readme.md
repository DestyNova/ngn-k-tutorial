## How to use this tutorial

This tutorial assumes you have some beginner programming knowledge, and a basic understanding of what arrays are.

The progression will start from explaining basic primitives, and move on to bigger concepts. The final few chapters will implement full programs in K,
step by step.

Each part of this tutorial covering the basics will have `Vocabulary` and `Exercise` (pending) sections at the end. I suggest getting familiar with the vocabulary
and doing the exercises in each part before moving on the next lesson.

If you are feeling stuck with the tutorial's content or exercises, please come to the [ngn/k room on matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ngnk:matrix.org)
(recommended), the [APL farm](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/APL_Farm), or just open an issue here.

If you would like to check your exercise solutions with mine, you can check the `code` folder.

# Progress:
Currently, the main introduction to ngn/k is complete. All major verbs and adverbs are covered.
