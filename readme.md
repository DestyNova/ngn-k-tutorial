# ngn-k-tutorial
An [ngn/k](https://codeberg.org/ngn/k) tutorial.

## How to use this tutorial

This tutorial assumes you have some beginner programming knowledge, and a basic understanding of what arrays are.

The progression will start from explaining basic primitives, and move on to bigger concepts. The final few chapters will implement full programs in K, step by step.

Each part of this tutorial will have `Vocabulary` and `Exercise` (pending) sections at the end. I suggest getting familiar with the vocabulary and doing the exercises in each part before moving on the next lesson.

# Progress:
Currently, the main introduction to ngn/k is complete. More practical chapters will be added.
